# EYE DISEASE DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING

In this project we are classifying various types of Eye Diseases that people get due to various reasons like age, diabetes, etc. These diseases are majorly classified into 4 categories namely Normal, cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy & Glaucoma. Deep-learning (DL) methods in artificial intelligence (AI) play a dominant role as high-performance classifiers in the detection of the Eye Diseases using images. 

Transfer learning has become one of the most common techniques that has achieved better performance in many areas, especially in image analysis and classification. We used Transfer Learning techniques like Inception V3, VGG19, Xception V3 that are more widely used as a transfer learning method in image analysis and they are highly effective.

The dataset is collected from the kaggle :
